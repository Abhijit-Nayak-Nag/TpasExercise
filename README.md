**HashMap:**
Write a program to create a HashMap where the keys are Strings (representing names) and the values are Integers (representing ages). Add some entries and then iterate through the HashMap, printing each key-value pair.<br>
Write a program to remove an entry from a HashMap given the key.<br>
Write a program to check if a specific key exists in a HashMap.<br>
**HashSet:**

Write a program to check if a specific element exists in a HashSet.<br>

**Java 8:**
**Lambda Expressions:**
Write a program that uses lambda expressions to implement a simple interface (e.g., Runnable, Comparator).<br>
Rewrite a traditional anonymous inner class with a lambda expression.<br>
**Streams:**
Write a program that uses Streams to filter a list of strings based on a condition.<br>
Write a program that uses Streams to map a list of integers to their squares.<br>
Write a program that uses Streams to find the maximum element in a list of integers.<br>
**Functional Interfaces:**
Write a custom functional interface and use it with lambda expressions.<br>
Write a program that takes a list of strings and sorts them based on their length using a Comparator composed with lambda expressions.<br>
**Method References:**
Write a program that demonstrates method references with a static method.<br>
Write a program that demonstrates method references with an instance method of an object.<br>
**Optional:**
Write a program that uses Optional to handle a potentially null value.<br>
Write a program that uses Optional to retrieve a value from a map and handle the absence of that key gracefully.<br>
**Default Methods:**
Write a program that demonstrates the use of default methods in interfaces.<br>
Write a program that demonstrates multiple inheritance of default methods from interfaces.<br>

**Multithreading:**
**Creating Threads:**
Write a program to create a simple thread by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method.<br>
Write a program to create a thread by implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread object.<br>
**Synchronization:**
Write a program to demonstrate synchronization using the synchronized keyword.<br>
Write a program to demonstrate synchronization using synchronized methods.<br>
**Thread Pools:**
Write a program to create a fixed-size thread pool using Executors.newFixedThreadPool() and submit tasks to it.<br>
Write a program to create a cached thread pool using Executors.newCachedThreadPool() and submit tasks to it.<br>
**CompletableFuture:**
Write a program to create a CompletableFuture and supply a result using CompletableFuture.completedFuture().<br>
Write a program to create a CompletableFuture and supply a result asynchronously using CompletableFuture.supplyAsync().<br>
Write a program to combine two CompletableFutures and perform some action when both are complete using thenCombine().<br>
**Thread Coordination:**
Write a program to demonstrate thread coordination using wait() and notify().<br>
Write a program to demonstrate thread coordination using CountDownLatch.<br>
**Concurrency Utilities:**
Write a program to demonstrate the use of Semaphore to control access to a shared resource.<br>
Write a program to demonstrate the use of CyclicBarrier to synchronize threads at a barrier point.<br>
**Exception Handling:**
**Basic Exception Handling:**
Write a program that divides two numbers entered by the user. Handle the ArithmeticException that may occur if the divisor is zero.<br>
**Custom Exception:**
Define a custom exception class called InvalidAgeException. Write a program that takes the age of a person as input and throws InvalidAgeException if the age is less than 0 or greater than 150.<br>
**Try-Catch-Finally:**
Write a program to read integers from the user until the user enters "done". Calculate the average of the entered numbers and handle any NumberFormatException that may occur.<br>
**Multiple Catch Blocks:**
Write a program that takes two integers as input and performs division. Handle both ArithmeticException and InputMismatchException.<br>
**Nested Try-Catch Blocks:**
Write a program that reads a file path from the user and attempts to open the file. Handle both FileNotFoundException and IOException.<br>
**Throwing Exceptions:**
Write a method called validateEmail that accepts an email address as a parameter and throws an IllegalArgumentException if the email address is not valid (e.g., doesn't contain "@" symbol).<br>
**Chained Exceptions:**
Write a program that reads an integer from the user and attempts to convert it to a String. Handle NumberFormatException and throw a custom exception ConversionException with the original exception as the cause.
